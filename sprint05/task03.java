/*
 * Create class Animal with fields age (int) and weight (double) that can be accessed in the same package
 * and only from within Animal class and its descendants in other packages. 
 * Animal should have method move without implementation, accessible from everywhere in the application.
 * Animal should have a public constructor with parameters age and weight for initialization corresponding fields.
 * Create Descendant classes Mammal, Fish, and Bird. 
 * For Mammal method move returns "run", for Fish - "swim", for Bird - "fly".
 * Make it impossible to create descendants of Fish and Bird.
 * Forbid overriding method move for Mammal.
